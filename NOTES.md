### TODOs

* Add other sorting algorithms
* How to show and add parallelization to sorting algorithms?
* I can keep it as it is and in future make backend & frontend, using tokio & yew, deploy to heroku?
* But need to adjust everything in sorted values to look good, because as it is right now it is not that good enough with representation
